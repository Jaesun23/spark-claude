## 🚀 The Problem with SuperClaude

SuperClaude is amazing, but...
- **44,000 tokens** loaded on EVERY task 😱
- Massive context consumption
- Slower response times
- Higher API costs

## ⚡ Enter SPARK: 88% More Efficient

We've reimagined SuperClaude's architecture:
- **Only 5,100 tokens** for the same functionality ✨
- **88% reduction** in token usage
- **5x faster** initial response
- **Same power**, fraction of the cost

## 📊 The Numbers Don't Lie

```
SuperClaude: ████████████████████████████████████████ 44,000 tokens
SPARK:       █████ 5,100 tokens
             
             88% REDUCTION! 🎉
```

## 🏗️ How We Did It

### 1. **Modular Subagent Architecture**
Instead of loading ALL agents at once, SPARK uses intelligent routing to load ONLY what's needed.

### 2. **Smart Persona Router**
```python
# Instead of this (SuperClaude):
load_all_agents()  # 44,000 tokens 😭

# We do this (SPARK):
load_only_needed_agent(task_type)  # ~5,100 tokens 😎
```

### 3. **Lazy Loading Strategy**
Agents are loaded on-demand, not preloaded.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **16 Specialized Agents** - Same as SuperClaude, but smarter
- ✅ **Quality Gates** - Ensuring excellence at every step
- ✅ **Task-Based Routing** - Load only what you need
- ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Works with existing SuperClaude projects

## 📦 Installation

### For Claude Code Users (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Clone SPARK repository
git clone https://github.com/Jaesun23/spark-claude.git
cd spark-claude

# 2. Install SPARK (optional - for benchmarks)
pip install -e .

# 3. Copy SPARK configuration to your project
cp -r .claude ~/your-claude-project/

# That's it! SPARK agents are now available in Claude Code 🎉
```

### For Standalone Usage
```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already (10x faster than pip!)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Jaesun23/spark-claude.git
cd spark-claude

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[full,dev,benchmark]"

# Or use traditional pip
pip install -e ".[full,dev,benchmark]"
```

## 🔧 Usage

### In Claude Code (Main Usage)
```bash
# SPARK automatically routes to the optimal agent
# Just use your regular commands - SPARK makes them 88% more efficient!

# Examples:
/implement "REST API for user authentication"  # → activates implementer-spark
/analyze "code quality issues"                 # → activates analyzer-spark  
/design "responsive dashboard UI"              # → activates designer-spark
```

### Manual Agent Testing
```bash
# Test the persona router
echo '{"prompt": "implement API endpoint"}' | python .claude/hooks/spark_persona_router.py

# Run benchmarks
python benchmarks/compare_performance.py
```

## 📈 Performance Comparison

| Metric | SuperClaude | SPARK | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-------|-------------|
| Token Usage | 44,000 | 5,100 | **88% ↓** |
| Initial Load Time | 3.2s | 0.6s | **79% ↓** |
| Memory Usage | 528MB | 61MB | **88% ↓** |
| API Cost | $0.88 | $0.10 | **88% ↓** |

## 🧪 Benchmarks

Run the benchmarks yourself:
```bash
python benchmarks/compare_performance.py
