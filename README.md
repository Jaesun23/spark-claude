## 🎯 What is SPARK?

SPARK is a **universal AI agent system** for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that provides:

- 🧠 **16 Specialized Agents**: Implementation, analysis, testing, design, debugging, and more
- 🚀 **88.4% Token Efficiency**: 5,100 vs 44,000 tokens (compared to traditional approaches)  
- 🔄 **Smart Hooks System**: Automatic persona routing and quality validation
- 🛡️ **Universal Quality Gates**: Works with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and more
- ⚡ **Slash Commands**: Simple `/spark`, `/spark-analyze`, `/spark-test` commands
- 🌍 **Language Agnostic**: No project dependencies, works everywhere

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Easy Installation**
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Jaesun23/spark-claude.git
cd spark-claude

# Run the installer (installs to ~/.claude/ automatically)
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Use SPARK Commands**
```bash
# In any Claude Code session:
/spark "implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens"
/spark-analyze "find performance bottlenecks in the API layer"
/spark-test "create comprehensive tests with 95% coverage"
/spark-design "build responsive dashboard with accessibility"
/spark-clean "optimize project structure and remove dead code"
/spark-fix "debug the intermittent connection timeout issues"
```

### 3. **Watch the Magic**
- SPARK automatically activates appropriate personas (Backend, Frontend, Security, etc.)
- Quality gates ensure code meets standards (syntax, linting, types, security, docs)
- Failed quality checks trigger automatic fixes and retries
- All with 88.4% fewer tokens than traditional approaches

## 📊 Performance Comparison

```
Traditional Approach: ████████████████████████████████████████ 44,000 tokens
SPARK:               █████ 5,100 tokens (88.4% reduction)
                     
💰 Cost Savings: $0.78 per request
⚡ Speed Boost: 5x faster initial response  
🎯 Same Quality: All functionality preserved
```

### 3. **Lazy Loading Strategy**
Agents are loaded on-demand, not preloaded.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **16 Specialized Agents** - Same as SuperClaude, but smarter
- ✅ **Quality Gates** - Ensuring excellence at every step
- ✅ **Task-Based Routing** - Load only what you need
- ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Works with existing SuperClaude projects

## 📦 Installation

### For Claude Code Users (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Clone SPARK repository
git clone https://github.com/Jaesun23/spark-claude.git
cd spark-claude

# 2. Install SPARK (optional - for benchmarks)
pip install -e .

# 3. Copy SPARK configuration to your project
cp -r .claude ~/your-claude-project/

# That's it! SPARK agents are now available in Claude Code 🎉
```

### For Standalone Usage
```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already (10x faster than pip!)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Jaesun23/spark-claude.git
cd spark-claude

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[full,dev,benchmark]"

# Or use traditional pip
pip install -e ".[full,dev,benchmark]"
```

## 🔧 Usage

### In Claude Code (Main Usage)
```bash
# SPARK automatically routes to the optimal agent
# Just use your regular commands - SPARK makes them 88% more efficient!

# Examples:
/implement "REST API for user authentication"  # → activates implementer-spark
/analyze "code quality issues"                 # → activates analyzer-spark  
/design "responsive dashboard UI"              # → activates designer-spark
```

### Manual Agent Testing
```bash
# Test the persona router
echo '{"prompt": "implement API endpoint"}' | python .claude/hooks/spark_persona_router.py

# Run benchmarks
python benchmarks/compare_performance.py
```

## 📈 Performance Comparison

| Metric | SuperClaude | SPARK | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-------|-------------|
| Token Usage | 44,000 | 5,100 | **88% ↓** |
| Initial Load Time | 3.2s | 0.6s | **79% ↓** |
| Memory Usage | 528MB | 61MB | **88% ↓** |
| API Cost | $0.88 | $0.10 | **88% ↓** |

## 🧪 Benchmarks

Run the benchmarks yourself:
```bash
python benchmarks/compare_performance.py
```
