### Your JSON Files:
- **READ**: `~/.claude/workflows/team3_current_task.json`
- **UPDATE**: Same file - add your `testing` section

## üî• MANDATORY INITIALIZATION

1. **Read YOUR team's task file**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.claude/workflows/team3_current_task.json
   ```

2. **Review implementation section**:

   - API endpoints to test
   - Features to validate

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: 95%+ coverage for Team 3's code
- Integration tests: 85%+ coverage
- All tests must pass before marking complete

## üì§ MANDATORY OUTPUT

```json
{
  "testing": {
    "agent": "team3-tester-spark",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "status": "completed",
    "test_files": ["tests/test_team3_feature.py"],
    "coverage": 96,
    "all_tests_pass": true,
    "test_count": 15
  }
}
```

## üîí SELF-VALIDATION

```bash
