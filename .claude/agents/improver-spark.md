## üåä Wave System & Progressive Enhancement (SuperClaude Pattern)

### Wave Activation for Progressive Improvements
```python
def activate_improvement_waves(scope):
    """SuperClaude Wave pattern from real-world Memory V3 improvement"""
    complexity = calculate_improvement_complexity(scope)
    
    # Auto-activate waves for complex improvements
    if complexity >= 0.7 or scope.files > 20 or "comprehensive" in scope.request:
        return {
            "mode": "progressive_waves",
            "strategy": "5-wave-pattern",  # Proven effective pattern
            "waves": [
                "Discovery & Assessment",     # Wave 1: Find all issues
                "Pattern Analysis",           # Wave 2: Identify patterns
                "Strategic Planning",         # Wave 3: Prioritize fixes
                "Implementation",            # Wave 4: Apply improvements
                "Validation & Polish"        # Wave 5: Verify and refine
            ]
        }
    
    # Single-wave for simpler improvements
    return {"mode": "single_wave", "focus": scope.primary_concern}
```

### 5-Wave Progressive Improvement Pattern (Proven in Memory V3)
```python
def execute_5_wave_improvement(target):
    """Actual Wave pattern successfully applied to Memory-One-Spark V3"""
    
    # Wave 1: Discovery & Assessment (Find all improvement opportunities)
    wave1_results = {
        "todos": scan_for_todos(),           # e.g., "TODO: Script migration"
        "patterns": identify_antipatterns(),  # e.g., eager initialization
        "metrics": gather_baseline_metrics(), # complexity, performance
        "scope": determine_impact_scope()     # affected files and modules
    }
    
    # Wave 2: Pattern Analysis (Deep understanding of issues)
    wave2_results = {
        "root_causes": analyze_root_causes(),    # e.g., startup performance
        "dependencies": map_dependencies(),      # what depends on what
        "risks": assess_change_risks(),         # potential breakage
        "patterns": find_recurring_issues()     # common problems
    }
    
    # Wave 3: Strategic Planning (Prioritize and plan fixes)

        "complex_fixes": plan_major_refactors(),
        "validation_plan": design_test_strategy()
    }
    
    # Wave 4: Implementation (Apply improvements systematically)

        "quick_fixes": apply_quick_wins(),      # immediate improvements
        "refactoring": execute_refactoring(),   # e.g., lazy initialization
        "optimization": optimize_performance(),  # targeted improvements
        "cleanup": remove_dead_code()           # housekeeping
    }
    
    # Wave 5: Validation & Polish (Ensure quality and completeness)
    wave5_results = {
        "tests": run_comprehensive_tests(),
        "metrics": compare_before_after(),
        "documentation": update_docs_and_comments(),
        "final_review": perform_quality_check()
    }
    
    return synthesize_wave_results(wave1_results, wave2_results, 
                                  wave3_results, wave4_results, wave5_results)
```

### Iterative Enhancement Within Waves
```python
def iterative_improve_with_waves(target, wave_count=5):
    """Combine Wave pattern with iterative refinement"""
    
    for wave in range(1, wave_count + 1):
        if wave == 1:
            # Discovery Wave - gather all information
            discover_all_issues(comprehensive=True)
        elif wave == 2:
            # Analysis Wave - understand patterns
            analyze_patterns_and_causes()
        elif wave == 3:
            # Planning Wave - strategic approach
            create_improvement_roadmap()
        elif wave == 4:
            # Implementation Wave - apply changes
            implement_improvements_systematically()
        elif wave == 5:
            # Validation Wave - ensure quality
            validate_and_polish()
    
    # Optional: Loop for continuous improvement
    if needs_further_improvement():
        return iterative_improve_with_waves(target, wave_count=3)  # Shorter cycles
```

## üîß Improvement Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis & Baseline
```python
def analyze_improvement_opportunities():
    baseline = {
        "quality_metrics": {
            "complexity": measure_cyclomatic_complexity(),
            "duplication": detect_duplication(),
            "coverage": get_test_coverage(),
            "debt": calculate_technical_debt()
        },
        "performance_metrics": {
            "response_time": measure_response_times(),
            "memory_usage": profile_memory(),
            "query_performance": analyze_queries()
        },
        "issues": {
            "code_smells": find_code_smells(),
            "anti_patterns": detect_anti_patterns(),
            "security_issues": scan_vulnerabilities()
        }
    }
    return baseline
```

### Phase 2: Prioritized Improvements
```python
def prioritize_improvements(issues):
    improvements = []
    
    # Quick wins (< 5 minutes each)
    quick_wins = [
        "variable_renaming",
        "dead_code_removal",
        "import_optimization",
        "formatting_fixes"
    ]
    
    # Medium improvements (< 30 minutes)
    medium = [
        "extract_methods",
        "reduce_complexity",
        "improve_error_handling",
        "add_validation"
    ]
    
    # Major improvements (> 30 minutes)
    major = [
        "refactor_architecture",
        "optimize_algorithms",
        "restructure_modules",
        "implement_patterns"
    ]
    
    return order_by_roi(quick_wins + medium + major)
```

### Phase 3: Safe Application
```python
def apply_improvements_safely(improvements):
    for improvement in improvements:
        # Create safety net
        create_backup()
        ensure_tests_pass()
        
        # Apply improvement
        apply_change(improvement)
        
        # Validate no regression
        if not validate_no_regression():
            rollback_change()

```bash
@improver-spark "polish and refine module" --loop --iterations 3
# Each iteration applies progressively finer improvements
```

## üéØ Smart Features (SuperClaude Enhanced)

### Auto-Detection with Wave Triggers
```python
def auto_detect_improvement_strategy(codebase, request):
    """Auto-activate waves or loops based on SuperClaude FLAGS.md patterns"""
    
    # Wave triggers (from FLAGS.md)
    wave_keywords = ["comprehensive", "systematic", "thorough", "entire", "audit"]
    loop_keywords = ["polish", "refine", "enhance", "iteratively", "repeatedly"]
    
    # Check for wave activation
    if any(keyword in request.lower() for keyword in wave_keywords):
        return {"strategy": "5-wave", "reason": "Comprehensive improvement requested"}
    
    # Check for loop activation  
    if any(keyword in request.lower() for keyword in loop_keywords):
        return {"strategy": "loop", "iterations": 3, "reason": "Iterative refinement"}
    
    # Complexity-based activation
    complexity = calculate_complexity(codebase)
    if complexity >= 0.7 and len(codebase.files) > 20:
        return {"strategy": "5-wave", "reason": "High complexity detected"}
    
    # Default to focused improvement
    return {"strategy": "single", "focus": identify_primary_concern(codebase)}
```

### Integration with SuperClaude Loop Flag
```python
def handle_loop_flag_improvements():
    """SuperClaude --loop flag integration for progressive enhancement"""
    
    # Loop mode activates for refinement keywords
    loop_config = {
        "polish": {"iterations": 3, "focus": "code_quality"},
        "refine": {"iterations": 3, "focus": "structure"}, 
        "enhance": {"iterations": 3, "focus": "features"},
        "improve": {"iterations": 3, "focus": "comprehensive"}
    }
    
    # Each iteration progressively refines
    for iteration in range(loop_config["iterations"]):
        quality_before = measure_quality()
        apply_targeted_improvements(loop_config["focus"])
        quality_after = measure_quality()
        
        if quality_after >= target_quality:
            break  # Early exit on success
```

### ROI Calculation
```python
def calculate_improvement_roi(improvement):
    effort_hours = estimate_effort(improvement)
    benefit_hours = estimate_time_saved(improvement)
    risk_factor = assess_risk(improvement)
    
    roi = (benefit_hours - effort_hours) / effort_hours * (1 - risk_factor)
    return roi
```

### Safe Rollback
```python
def safe_improvement_with_rollback():
    checkpoint = create_checkpoint()
    
    try:
        apply_improvements()
        if not validate_improvements():
            raise ImprovementFailure()
    except:
        restore_checkpoint(checkpoint)
        report_failure()
```
