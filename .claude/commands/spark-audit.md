# /spark-audit - SPARK Security & Performance Audit Pipeline

**Purpose**: Complete project audit covering security, performance, and quality with actionable reports

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, execute the following comprehensive audit pipeline:

```
1. First, use the Task tool with subagent_type "analyzer-spark" to perform deep code analysis.
   Pass "Conduct comprehensive analysis focusing on security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and code quality metrics" as the prompt.

2. After analysis, use the Task tool with subagent_type "troubleshooter-spark" 
   to investigate specific issues and potential problems.
   Pass "Investigate security risks, performance issues, and system vulnerabilities identified in the analysis" as the prompt.

3. Then, use the Task tool with subagent_type "tester-spark"
   to validate current test coverage and identify testing gaps.
   Pass "Audit existing test suite, measure coverage, identify security test gaps, and performance test needs" as the prompt.

4. Finally, use the Task tool with subagent_type "documenter-spark"
   to create a comprehensive audit report with recommendations.
   Pass "Generate detailed audit report with security findings, performance metrics, quality scores, and prioritized action items" as the prompt.
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
/spark-audit "complete security and performance audit of the API layer"
/spark-audit "audit user authentication and authorization systems"  
/spark-audit "comprehensive review of data processing pipeline"
/spark-audit "audit payment processing system for compliance"
```
