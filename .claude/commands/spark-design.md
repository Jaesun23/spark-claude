# /spark-design - SPARK Design Command

**Purpose**: System design and UI/UX creation with architecture and accessibility expertise

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, use the Task tool to launch the designer-spark agent:

```
Use the Task tool with subagent_type "designer-spark" to perform design tasks.
Pass the user's specific design request as the prompt parameter.
The designer-spark agent will create designs with architecture and UI/UX best practices.
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
/spark-design "create responsive dashboard component with real-time data"
/spark-design "design system architecture for microservices application"  
/spark-design "build accessible form components following WCAG 2.1"
/spark-design "create mobile-first navigation component"
/spark-design "design database schema for e-commerce platform"
```
