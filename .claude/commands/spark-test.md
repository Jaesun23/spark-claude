# /spark-test - SPARK Testing Command

**Purpose**: Intelligent test generation, execution, and coverage analysis with SPARK enhancement

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, I will engage the tester-spark testing specialist:

The tester-spark specialist will:
- Generate comprehensive test suites based on the codebase
- Execute tests and analyze results
- Optimize for 95%+ code coverage
- Ensure all quality standards are met
- Provide detailed coverage reports and recommendations

## Usage Examples

```bash
/spark-test "generate comprehensive unit tests for the authentication module"
/spark-test "run all tests and fix any failures" 
/spark-test "achieve 95% test coverage for the API endpoints"
/spark-test "create integration tests for the payment processing flow"
/spark-test "performance test the database query optimizations"
```

## Testing Capabilities

- **Unit Tests**: Function/method level testing with proper mocks and fixtures
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing with realistic data
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full workflow testing using Playwright when available
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing and benchmarking for critical paths
- **Coverage Analysis**: Detailed coverage reporting with gap identification

## Quality Standards

All SPARK tests must meet:
- âœ… **95%+ Code Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of critical functionality
- âœ… **Fast Execution**: Unit tests complete in < 10s, integration tests < 30s
- âœ… **Clear Naming**: Descriptive test names following AAA pattern
- âœ… **Proper Isolation**: Tests are independent and can run in any order
- âœ… **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests cover edge cases and error conditions

## SPARK Intelligence Integration
