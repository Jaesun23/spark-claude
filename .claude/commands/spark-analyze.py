/spark-analyze - Multi-Dimensional Analysis Command

Analysis is an art of systematic investigation where multiple perspectives
converge to reveal truth. This command embodies the philosophy that understanding
comes not from a single viewpoint, but from examining systems through every
lens - performance, security, quality, architecture, and beyond.

Each analysis tells a story: where the system excels, where it struggles,
and most importantly, what paths lead to improvement.
