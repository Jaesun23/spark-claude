/spark-implement - Quality-Driven Implementation Command

This command embodies a philosophy of comprehensive, thoughtful implementation
that values elegance, maintainability, and thorough validation. It orchestrates
a complete development pipeline where quality isn't just checked but cultivated
at every step, ensuring deliverables that inspire confidence and pride.

The command strives for:
- Elegance in simplicity, not cleverness
- Thoughtful error handling that anticipates real-world usage
- Documentation that teaches, not just describes
- Tests that validate intent, not just coverage
- Code that reads like well-written prose
