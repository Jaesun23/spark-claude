# /research-and-document - SPARK Multi-Agent Research Pipeline

**Purpose**: Comprehensive research analysis followed by professional documentation generation

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, I will orchestrate a two-phase research and documentation pipeline:

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis
I will engage the analyzer-spark specialist to:
- Conduct thorough research and investigation
- Analyze the codebase, architecture, or system components
- Identify patterns, issues, and opportunities
- Generate evidence-based findings and metrics

### Phase 2: Documentation Generation
Following the analysis, I will activate the documenter-spark specialist to:
- Transform analysis results into professional documentation
- Create structured reports with clear sections
- Include executive summaries and actionable recommendations
- Generate comprehensive technical documentation

## Usage Examples

```bash
/research-and-document "investigate the performance characteristics of our authentication system"
/research-and-document "analyze the current API architecture and document best practices"
/research-and-document "research security vulnerabilities in the payment processing flow"
/research-and-document "study the user interface patterns and document design guidelines"
```

## Multi-Agent Benefits

- **Deep Analysis**: analyzer-spark provides evidence-based investigation
- **Professional Documentation**: documenter-spark creates structured, actionable reports
- **Seamless Integration**: Analysis results flow directly into documentation
- **SPARK Efficiency**: 88.4% token reduction vs separate analysis and documentation tasks

## Output Expectations

1. **Research Phase**: Comprehensive analysis with findings, metrics, and recommendations
2. **Documentation Phase**: Structured report with executive summary, detailed findings, and action items
