# /spark-fix - SPARK Troubleshooting Command

**Purpose**: Problem investigation, debugging, and root cause analysis with SPARK intelligence

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, use the Task tool to launch the troubleshooter-spark agent:

```
Use the Task tool with subagent_type "troubleshooter-spark" to investigate and fix issues.
Pass the user's specific problem description as the prompt parameter.
The troubleshooter-spark agent will systematically debug and resolve issues.
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
/spark-fix "API endpoints returning 500 errors intermittently"
/spark-fix "memory leak in the data processing pipeline"
/spark-fix "tests failing after dependency update" 
/spark-fix "performance degradation in search functionality"
/spark-fix "authentication system not working in production"
```

## Troubleshooting Capabilities

- **Error Investigation**: Systematic analysis of logs, stack traces, and error patterns
- **Performance Debugging**: Profiling, bottleneck identification, optimization
- **Integration Issues**: API failures, database connectivity, service communication
- **Environment Problems**: Configuration, deployment, dependency conflicts
- **Code Logic Bugs**: Logic errors, edge cases, race conditions

## Debugging Process

SPARK troubleshooting follows systematic approach:
1. **Problem Reproduction**: Isolate and reproduce the issue consistently
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Trace the issue to its underlying cause
3. **Solution Development**: Create targeted fix with minimal side effects
4. **Verification**: Test fix thoroughly and ensure no regressions
5. **Prevention**: Suggest improvements to prevent similar issues
