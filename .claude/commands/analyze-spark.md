# /analyze-spark - SPARK Analysis Command

**Purpose**: Multi-dimensional code and system analysis with evidence-based investigation

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, use the Task tool to launch the `analyzer-spark` agent with the user's request:

```
Use the Task tool with subagent_type "analyzer-spark" to perform comprehensive analysis. 
Pass the user's specific analysis request as the prompt parameter.
The analyzer-spark agent will conduct multi-perspective analysis and provide evidence-based insights.
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
/analyze-spark "performance bottlenecks in the API layer"
/analyze-spark "security vulnerabilities in authentication system" 
/analyze-spark "code complexity and maintainability metrics"
/analyze-spark "dependency graph and potential issues"
```

## Analysis Capabilities

- **Performance Analysis**: Bottlenecks, memory usage, optimization opportunities
- **Security Analysis**: Vulnerabilities, attack vectors, compliance issues  
- **Code Quality**: Complexity metrics, maintainability, technical debt
- **Architecture**: Structure analysis, coupling, cohesion patterns
- **Dependencies**: Vulnerability scanning, usage optimization

## SPARK Intelligence Integration

This command leverages SPARK's intelligent routing to:
- Activate appropriate personas based on analysis type
- Select optimal MCP servers for data gathering
- Apply 88.4% token efficiency vs traditional approaches
- Ensure quality gates validation of analysis results
