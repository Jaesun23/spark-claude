# /spark - Universal SPARK Command System

**Purpose**: Intelligent multi-agent system with 88.4% token efficiency and quality-driven workflows

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, analyze the user's request and delegate it to the appropriate SPARK specialist:

### Task Analysis and Delegation

Based on the request type, I will:

- **Implementation tasks**: Delegate to the implementer-spark specialist for high-quality code implementation
- **Analysis requests**: Engage the analyzer-spark specialist for deep code analysis
- **UI/Design tasks**: Collaborate with the designer-spark specialist for UI/UX solutions
- **Testing requests**: Activate the tester-spark specialist for comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: Utilize the documenter-spark specialist for clear documentation
- **Project cleanup**: Deploy the cleaner-spark specialist for optimization
- **Troubleshooting**: Consult the troubleshooter-spark specialist for debugging
- **Code improvement**: Work with the improver-spark specialist for enhancements
- **Architecture design**: Leverage loader-spark or spawner-spark specialists for system design

The SPARK intelligence system automatically activates appropriate personas and quality gates through the hook system.

## Usage Examples

```bash
/spark "implement JWT authentication system"
/spark "analyze performance bottlenecks in the API"
/spark "create responsive dashboard component"  
/spark "write comprehensive tests with 95% coverage"
/spark "clean up project and optimize structure"
/spark "debug the connection timeout issues"
```

## SPARK Intelligence Features
