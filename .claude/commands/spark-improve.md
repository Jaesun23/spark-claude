# /spark-improve - SPARK Code Improvement Command

**Purpose**: Systematic code improvement and technical debt reduction with SPARK intelligence

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, I will engage the improver-spark specialist:

The improver-spark specialist will:
- Analyze code quality, performance, security, and architecture comprehensively
- Create systematic improvement plans using 5-Phase methodology
- Execute refactoring, optimization, and enhancement implementations
- Validate all changes through rigorous testing and quality gates
- Generate detailed improvement reports with before/after metrics

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

```bash
/spark-improve "legacy authentication module with performance issues"
/spark-improve "database layer with N+1 queries and security vulnerabilities" 
/spark-improve "monolithic service with high complexity and technical debt"
/spark-improve "frontend components with poor performance and accessibility"
```

## ðŸ“Š Quality Standards

### Jason's 8-Step Quality Gates (Must Pass All)
1. **Syntax Validation** (0 errors)
2. **Type Checking** - MyPy --strict (0 errors)  
3. **Linting** - Ruff --strict (0 violations)
4. **Security Analysis** - OWASP + secrets scan
5. **Test Coverage** - Unit 95%, Integration 85%
6. **Performance Check** - No regression
7. **Documentation Validation** - Docstrings required
8. **Integration Testing** - E2E scenarios pass

### Success Criteria
- âœ… All 8 quality gates pass
- âœ… Code quality metrics improved measurably
- âœ… No breaking changes to public APIs
- âœ… Comprehensive improvement documentation generated

## ðŸŽ¯ SPARK Efficiency

- **Direct Delegation**: Single agent handles complete lifecycle
- **5-Phase Methodology**: Built-in systematic approach
- **Auto-Retry**: Max 3 attempts on quality gate failures
- **Token Efficient**: No multi-agent coordination overhead
- **Self-Contained**: improver-spark includes analysis, implementation, testing, documentation
