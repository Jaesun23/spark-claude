# /spark-launch - SPARK Full-Stack Feature Launch Pipeline

**Purpose**: Complete feature development from design to deployment with quality assurance

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, execute the following end-to-end development pipeline:

```
1. First, use the Task tool with subagent_type "designer-spark" to create feature design and architecture.
   Pass the user's feature request with "Design complete architecture, UI/UX, API specifications, and database schema for:" as prefix.

2. After design completion, use the Task tool with subagent_type "implementer-spark"
   to build the feature according to the design specifications.
   Pass "Implement the feature based on the previous design specifications, following all architectural decisions" as the prompt.

3. Once implementation is done, use the Task tool with subagent_type "tester-spark"
   to create comprehensive test suite covering all aspects.
   Pass "Create comprehensive test suite including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with 95%+ coverage" as the prompt.

4. After testing, use the Task tool with subagent_type "documenter-spark"
   to create complete documentation for the feature.
   Pass "Generate complete feature documentation including API docs, user guides, and developer documentation" as the prompt.

5. Finally, use the Task tool with subagent_type "gitter-spark"
   to prepare for deployment with proper version control.
   Pass "Prepare feature for deployment: create proper commits, tags, and deployment documentation" as the prompt.
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
/spark-launch "user notification system with email and SMS support"
/spark-launch "real-time chat feature with file sharing capabilities"
/spark-launch "advanced search functionality with filters and sorting"
/spark-launch "user dashboard with analytics and reporting"
/spark-launch "payment processing system with multiple gateways"
```

## Pipeline Benefits

- **Complete Feature Lifecycle**: From concept to deployment-ready
- **Design-First Approach**: Proper architecture before implementation  
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing at every level
- **Production Ready**: Full documentation and deployment prep
- **Version Control**: Proper Git workflow and release management

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Technical Design**: Architecture diagrams, API specs, database schema
2. **Working Implementation**: Complete, tested feature code
3. **Test Suite**: Comprehensive tests with high coverage
4. **Documentation**: User guides, API docs, developer documentation  
5. **Deployment Package**: Ready-to-deploy with proper versioning
