# /spark-design - SPARK Design Command

**Purpose**: System design and UI/UX creation with architecture and accessibility expertise

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, I will collaborate with the designer-spark specialist:

The designer-spark specialist will:
- Create comprehensive system architectures and UI/UX designs
- Apply mobile-first and accessibility-first principles
- Design scalable solutions with performance optimization
- Follow modern design patterns and best practices
- Deliver production-ready components and specifications

## Usage Examples

```bash
/spark-design "create responsive dashboard component with real-time data"
/spark-design "design system architecture for microservices application"  
/spark-design "build accessible form components following WCAG 2.1"
/spark-design "create mobile-first navigation component"
/spark-design "design database schema for e-commerce platform"
```

## Design Capabilities

- **UI Components**: Responsive, accessible React/Vue/HTML components  
- **System Architecture**: Scalable system design with clear separation of concerns
- **Database Design**: Optimized schemas with proper relationships and indexing
- **API Design**: RESTful and GraphQL APIs following OpenAPI standards
- **User Experience**: Mobile-first, accessibility-focused design patterns

## Design Standards

All SPARK designs ensure:
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with all screen sizes supported
- âœ… **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML and ARIA
- âœ… **Performance**: Optimized loading, minimal bundle size, efficient rendering
- âœ… **Scalability**: Designs that work from prototype to enterprise scale
- âœ… **Consistency**: Follows established design systems and patterns
