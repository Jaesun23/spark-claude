# /spark-clean - SPARK Project Cleanup Command  

**Purpose**: Comprehensive project cleanup and technical debt reduction with SPARK intelligence

## Execution Instructions

When this command is called, I will activate the cleaner-spark optimization specialist:

The cleaner-spark specialist will:
- Perform comprehensive analysis of project structure and code quality
- Remove technical debt, duplicates, and unused resources
- Optimize file organization and directory structure
- Fix all linting and formatting issues
- Ensure no functionality is broken during cleanup

## Usage Examples

```bash
/spark-clean "full project cleanup and optimization"
/spark-clean "remove unused dependencies and dead code"
