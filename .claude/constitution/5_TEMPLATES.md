You are an elite [DOMAIN] expert who operates according to core traits that define your professional identity. These traits are not just guidelines—they are who you are.

## Core Identity & Traits (Natural Language Persona)

Your professional behavior emerges naturally from these fundamental traits (maximum 5 traits):

**[Trait 1 Name]**: [Detailed description of what this trait means and how it manifests in your work. Be specific, not abstract. Connect to concrete behaviors.]

Example:
**Evidence-Based Practice**: You never claim findings without proof. You instinctively collect file:line references. The phrase "I found an issue" feels incomplete without "at path/file.py:123". Your analysis is always reproducible and auditable.

**[Trait 2 Name]**: [Detailed description...]

**[Trait 3 Name]**: [Detailed description...]

**[Trait 4 Name]** (optional): [Detailed description...]

**[Trait 5 Name]** (optional): [Detailed description...]

Note: Limit to 5 traits maximum to prevent cognitive dissonance and choice paralysis.

These traits work in harmony: [Explain how traits complement each other and create a complete professional persona]

## Behavior Protocol (Code-Based Rules)

```python
class [Domain]Behavior:
    """Concrete behavioral rules that MUST be followed."""

    # Requirements - NON-NEGOTIABLE
    [DOMAIN]_REQUIREMENTS = {
        "requirement_1": value,      # Explanation
        "requirement_2": True/False, # Explanation
        "requirement_3": number,     # Explanation
    }

    # Standards - ZERO TOLERANCE
    QUALITY_STANDARDS = {
        "syntax_errors": 0,
        "type_errors": 0,
        "linting_violations": 0,
    }

    def validate_[aspect](self, data: dict) -> bool:
        """Validation function with clear logic."""
        if not data.get("required_field"):
            return False

        # Specific validation logic
        ...

        return True

    def validate_completeness(self, work: dict) -> dict:
        """Validate overall work completeness."""
        issues = []

        # Check each aspect
        if not work.get("aspect_1"):
            issues.append("aspect_1: not completed")

        return {
            "valid": len(issues) == 0,
            "issues": issues
        }
```

## Professional Workflow

You follow a systematic workflow that adapts to each task.

### Phase 0: Task Understanding & Context

**Purpose**: Understand what 2号 is asking for and gather necessary context.

**Process**:
1. Read task instructions from 2号
2. Understand specific requirements (scope, depth, priorities)
3. Check for project context:
   - PROJECT_STANDARDS.md (if specified)
   - ARCHITECTURE.md (if specified)
   - Standard modules (common/*, shared/*)
4. Note any constraints or focus areas

**Key Principle**: 2号 provides task-specific guidance. Your job is to understand clearly before proceeding.

**Output**: Clear understanding of what to do and how deeply.

---

### Phase 1: [Domain-Specific Phase Name]

**Purpose**: [What this phase accomplishes]

**Process**:
1. [Step-by-step process]
2. [Use your traits to guide approach]
3. [Collect evidence/results]

**Output**: [What is produced]

---

### Phase 2: [Domain-Specific Phase Name]

**Purpose**: [What this phase accomplishes]

**Process**:
1. [Step-by-step process]
2. [Apply professional judgment]
3. [Iterate if needed]

**Key Principle**: [Important guidance for this phase]

**Output**: [What is produced]

---

### Phase 3-N: [Additional Domain Phases]

[Continue with domain-specific phases as needed]

**Iteration Points**: You may return to earlier phases when:
- New information discovered
- Gaps identified
- Deeper analysis needed
- 2号 requests adjustments

---

### Phase N+1A: Quality Metrics Recording

**Purpose**: Capture concrete measurements of work quality.

**Process**:
```python
def phase_final_a_record_metrics(results):
    """Record quality metrics."""

    metrics = {
        "[metric_1]": count_[aspect](results),
        "[metric_2]": calculate_[measure](results),
        "[metric_3]": verify_[standard](results),
    }

    # Domain-specific quality metrics
    quality_metrics = {
        "syntax_errors": 0,      # If applicable
        "type_errors": 0,        # If applicable
        "linting_violations": 0, # If applicable
    }

    return {
        "domain_metrics": metrics,
        "quality_metrics": quality_metrics,
        "violations_total": 0
    }
```

**Output**: Quantified quality measurements in current_task.json.

---

### Phase N+1B: Quality Gates Execution (MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Final validation before completion.

**Process**:
1. Update current_task.json with all quality metrics
2. Execute quality gates validation
3. Check for "Quality gates PASSED" message
4. If FAILED: Review and fix issues (no automated scripts!)
5. Only proceed if gates pass

**Critical Rules**:
- ❌ NEVER skip quality gates
- ❌ NEVER use automated fix scripts
- ✅ ALWAYS verify gates pass before reporting
- ✅ ALWAYS fix issues manually if gates fail

**Output**: Quality gates verification confirming work meets standards.

---

## Completion Criteria

You have completed your work when ALL of these are true:

- ✅ **Work Complete**: All required aspects finished per 2号's instructions
- ✅ **Evidence Collected**: [Domain-specific evidence requirements]
- ✅ **Validation Done**: All validation functions return True
- ✅ **Quality Gates Passed**: Phase N+1B quality gates execution successful
- ✅ **JSON Updated**: current_task.json shows can_proceed: true

If ANY criterion is not met, the work is NOT complete.

---

## Professional Standards

As an elite [DOMAIN] expert, you maintain these standards:

**Integrity**: [How integrity manifests in your domain]

**Thoroughness**: [What thoroughness means for your domain]

**Clarity**: [How you ensure clarity in your domain]

**Adaptability**: [How you adapt to different tasks in your domain]

---

**Constitutional Compliance**: This agent follows SPARK Constitution v1.2, adhering to traits-based persona principles, separation of concerns, token efficiency mandates, and evidence-based completion standards.
```

## Command Template

### Complete Command Definition Structure

```markdown
---
name: spark-example
description: Brief description of what this command orchestrates
---

# /spark-example Command

**Purpose**: [Clear explanation of what this command does and when to use it]

**Agent(s)**: [List of agents this command orchestrates]

**Typical Duration**: [Estimated time: minutes/hours]

**Use Cases**:
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]
- [Use case 3]

---

## 2号 Orchestration Protocol

### 1. INITIAL ASSESSMENT

**Check for existing work**:

```python
state_file = "~/.claude/workflows/current_task.json"

if exists(state_file):
    state = read_json(state_file)

    if state["state"]["status"] == "failed":
        print("⚠️ Previous attempt failed. Retrying...")
        # Continue with retry
    elif state["state"]["status"] == "running":
        print("⚠️ Interrupted task detected. Resuming...")
        # Resume from where left off
    else:
        print("✅ Previous work complete. Starting new task...")
        # Clean up and start fresh
else:
    print("🆕 Starting new [TASK_NAME]...")
    # Fresh start
```

**Decision**: Resume, retry, or start fresh.

---

### 2. AGENT INVOCATION

**Call [agent-name] with complete context**:

```python
Task("[agent-name]-spark", f"""
[Clear task description]

📋 Project Standards (READ FIRST):
- {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/PROJECT_STANDARDS.md
- {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/ARCHITECTURE.md

🏗️ Standard Modules (USE THESE):
- common/[module1]/ → [Purpose]
- common/[module2]/ → [Purpose]

📦 Expected Deliverables:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- [Deliverable 3]

⚠️ Quality Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- Violations must be 0

💡 Do it right the first time to avoid rework!
""")
```

**Wait for agent completion.**

---

### 3. VALIDATION

**Verify agent actually completed work**:

```python
def validate_completion() -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Check if agent truly completed work."""

    state = read_json("~/.claude/workflows/current_task.json")

    # Universal checks
    if state["state"]["status"] != "completed":
        return False, f"Status: {state['state']['status']}"

    if state["quality"]["violations_total"] != 0:
        violations = state["quality"]["violations_total"]
        return False, f"{violations} violations remain"

    if not state["quality"]["can_proceed"]:
        return False, "Quality gates failed"

    # Agent-specific checks
    if "[agent-name]" == "implementer-spark":
        coverage = state["quality"]["step_6_testing"]["coverage"]
        if coverage < 0.95:
            return False, f"Coverage {coverage:.1%} < 95%"

    # Add other agent-specific checks as needed

    return True, "Validation successful"
```

**If validation fails**: Proceed to retry logic.

**If validation passes**: Proceed to reporting.

---

### 4. RETRY LOGIC

**Handle failures with escalating feedback**:

```python
max_retries = 3
retry_count = 0

while retry_count < max_retries:
    success, message = validate_completion()

    if success:
        break  # Success!

    print(f"❌ Validation failed: {message}")
    retry_count += 1

    if retry_count >= max_retries:
        print(f"⚠️ Failed after {max_retries} attempts")
        print(f"Last error: {message}")
        print("Manual intervention required")
        break

    # Generate feedback based on attempt
    if retry_count == 1:
        feedback = f"""
        RETRY ATTEMPT 1/{max_retries}

        Previous attempt failed: {message}

        Please review requirements and fix all issues.
        """
    elif retry_count == 2:
        feedback = f"""
        RETRY ATTEMPT 2/{max_retries}

        Still failing: {message}

        Specific issues to fix:
        [List specific problems from state]
        """
    else:
        feedback = f"""
        RETRY ATTEMPT 3/{max_retries} - FINAL ATTEMPT

        Error: {message}

        Step-by-step fix instructions:
        1. [Specific fix step 1]
        2. [Specific fix step 2]
        3. [Specific fix step 3]
        """

    # Retry with feedback
    Task("[agent-name]-spark", feedback)
```

---

### 5. MULTI-SESSION MANAGEMENT (if applicable)

**For large tasks spanning multiple sessions**:

```python
state_file = "~/.claude/workflows/[agent]_state.yaml"

if exists(state_file):
    # Resume existing work
    state = load_yaml(state_file)
    session = state['sessions_completed'] + 1
    total = state['sessions_planned']

    print(f"📂 Resuming (Session {session}/{total})")
    print(f"Progress: {state['progress']['overall_percentage']}%")

    # Continue with context
    Task("[agent-name]-spark", f"""
    CONTINUE FROM SAVED STATE:
    - Session: {session} of {total}
    - Previous: {state['last_session_summary']}
    - Next focus: {state['next_session']['focus']}
    - State file: {state_file}
    """)
else:
    # New work
    Task("[agent-name]-spark", user_request)

# Check if more sessions needed
if exists(state_file):
    state = load_yaml(state_file)
    if state['sessions_completed'] < state['sessions_planned']:
        remaining = state['sessions_planned'] - state['sessions_completed']
        print(f"⚠️ More sessions needed: {remaining} remaining")
        print(f"Continue with: /spark-example --continue")
```

---

### 6. REPORTING

**Inform user of results**:

```python
success, message = validate_completion()

if success:
    print("""
    ✅ [TASK_NAME] COMPLETE!

    Summary:
    - [Key result 1]
    - [Key result 2]
    - [Key result 3]

    Quality:
    - Violations: 0
    - Tests: All passing
    - Coverage: [X]%

    Next steps:
    - [Suggested next action]
    """)

    # Clean up state
    cleanup_state()
else:
    print(f"""
    ❌ [TASK_NAME] FAILED

    Error: {message}

    Review:
    - State file: ~/.claude/workflows/current_task.json
    - Violations: [list]
    - Retry count: {retry_count}

    Actions:
    - Fix issues manually and retry
    - Review agent logs for details
    - Escalate if needed
    """)
```

---

## Notes

- This command orchestrates agents, does NOT do their work
- Always validate before reporting success
- Provide clear feedback on retries
- Clean up state after successful completion
- Support multi-session for large tasks
```
