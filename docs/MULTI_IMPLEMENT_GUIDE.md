# 🚀 Multi-Implement Guide - 4-Team Parallel Execution

## 📋 Overview

`/multi-implement` is SPARK's most powerful command that enables **4 teams to work in parallel** on independent implementation tasks. This achieves up to **3.1x faster execution** compared to sequential implementation.

## 🎯 When to Use Multi-Implement

### ✅ Perfect For:
- Multiple independent features (no shared dependencies)
- API endpoints that don't share models
- Separate UI components
- Independent microservices
- Different modules or packages

### ❌ Not Suitable For:
- Interdependent features
- Tasks that modify the same files extensively
- Sequential workflows (A must complete before B)
- Single large feature that can't be split

## 📝 Command Syntax

```bash
# Basic usage with task IDs
/multi-implement "TASK-API-01" "TASK-UI-02" "TASK-SEC-03" "TASK-DATA-04"

# With task descriptions (more flexible)
/multi-implement "User auth endpoint" "Dashboard component" "Security middleware" "Data pipeline"

# 2-3 tasks also work
/multi-implement "Feature A" "Feature B"
```

## 🔄 Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Initialization (2호)
```python
1. Parse command and extract tasks
2. Validate task independence
3. Create team JSON files with task details
4. Identify potential resource conflicts
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation
```python
# ALL CALLS AT ONCE - TRUE PARALLELISM!
Task("team1-implementer-spark", task1_with_json)
Task("team2-implementer-spark", task2_with_json)
Task("team3-implementer-spark", task3_with_json)
Task("team4-implementer-spark", task4_with_json)

# WAIT for ALL teams to complete
```

### Phase 3: Parallel Testing
```python
# After implementation, test in parallel
Task("team1-tester-spark", test1)
Task("team2-tester-spark", test2)
Task("team3-tester-spark", test3)
Task("team4-tester-spark", test4)

# WAIT for ALL tests to complete
```

### Phase 4: Consolidation
- 2호 reviews all team results
- Generates unified report
- Handles any integration needs

## 📊 JSON Context Structure

Each team works with its own JSON file for complete isolation:

```json
{
  "team_id": "team1",
  "task_id": "TASK-API-01",
  "status": "implementing|testing|complete",
  "task_details": {
    "description": "Create user authentication endpoint",
    "files_to_modify": ["api/auth.py", "models/user.py"],
    "requirements": ["JWT tokens", "bcrypt hashing"]
  },
  "implementation": {
    "files_created": ["api/auth.py"],
    "files_modified": ["models/user.py"],
    "quality_results": {
      "mypy": "passed",
      "ruff": "passed",
      "security": "passed"
    }
  },
  "testing": {
    "test_files": ["tests/test_auth.py"],
    "coverage": 96.5,
    "results": "All tests passed"
  },
  "locks_held": ["models/user.py"],
  "messages": ["Waiting for lock on shared resource"]
}
```

## 🔒 Resource Lock Management

For shared files (e.g., `constants.py`, `types.py`):

1. **Team requests lock** via JSON
2. **2호 manages allocation** (first-come-first-served)
3. **30-second timeout** prevents deadlocks
4. **Automatic release** on completion

Example lock request:
```json
{
  "lock_request": {
    "file": "shared/constants.py",
    "operation": "append",
    "priority": "normal"
  }
}
```

## ⚡ Performance Metrics

| Tasks | Sequential Time | Parallel Time | Speedup |
|-------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| 2     | 10 min         | 5.5 min       | 1.8x    |
| 3     | 15 min         | 6 min         | 2.5x    |
| 4     | 20 min         | 6.5 min       | 3.1x    |

*Note: Actual speedup depends on task complexity and dependencies*

## 🎯 Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Split large features into independent components
✅ Use clear task IDs or descriptions
✅ Plan file structure to minimize conflicts
✅ Let teams work on different directories
✅ Trust the parallel execution (don't interrupt)

### DON'T:
❌ Check on individual teams during execution
❌ Modify team JSON files manually
❌ Use for interdependent tasks
❌ Exceed 4 tasks (context window limit)
❌ Mix implementation with refactoring

## 🔧 Configuration

The `multi_implement.py` utility provides:
- Task validation
- Team agent generation
- Execution plan creation
- Resource conflict detection
- Progress tracking

## 💡 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: API Development
```bash
/multi-implement \
  "User registration endpoint" \
  "User login endpoint" \
  "Password reset endpoint" \
  "Profile update endpoint"
```

### Scenario 2: UI Components
```bash
/multi-implement \
  "Header component with navigation" \
  "Sidebar with menu items" \
  "Footer with links" \
  "Dashboard cards"
```

### Scenario 3: Microservices
```bash
/multi-implement \
  "Auth service setup" \
  "Payment service integration" \
  "Notification service" \
  "Analytics service"
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

1. **Maximum 4 teams** - Claude's context window constraint
2. **No direct communication** - Teams work independently
3. **Synchronous phases** - All teams wait for slowest
4. **File conflicts** - Shared file edits are serialized
5. **No mid-execution changes** - Can't modify tasks once started

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Teams not starting in parallel
- Check that 2호 is calling all Tasks at once
- Verify JSON files are created correctly
- Ensure no syntax errors in command

### File conflicts
- Review lock requests in team JSONs
- Check for deadlock situations
- Consider restructuring tasks

### Quality gate failures
- Each team runs independent quality checks
- Fix issues in respective team's implementation
- Re-run only the failed team
